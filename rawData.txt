4e6bd7523b759607e30024bf40578P40578 Looking ahead to our meeting on Tuesday, there are three Canadian Top Tens without any credit activity.  Can we delete these  Legal cannot move forward without credits response.  Thanks.  Sara  
4e6bd7523b759607e300250140578P40578 Tana:  Please prepare a letter agreement amending the terms of the ETA for Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC.  (You can call Pat Clark, their attorney, at 724 838 6217 if you need the address of this CP.)  The following should be included in the ETA, to the standard form of this agreement:  1.  Section 1 of the ETA is hereby amended by inserting the words "executed by the Parties" following the phrase "(i) master agreement or agreements or other written agreements."  2.  Section 2(b) of the ETA is hereby amended by inserting the phrase "subject to the terms of any confidentiality provisions set forth in this Agreement, including Section 5, or in any master agreement or the GTC entered into between theh Parties with respect to any Transaction" at the end thereof.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Leslie  
4e6bd7523b759607e300250540578NP40578 Does anyone know this guy and should we interview him  
4e6bd7523b759607e300250f40578NP40578 You guys should enjoy this  especially the last one.   Reed, you never called back you wimpy Pantani butt pirate.  Ive got a big case settling and am more likely going to have a shot at blasting out for a couple days of fishing. Let me know whether fishing is worth a shit out there.  DF  
4e6bd7523b759607e300251140578P40578 Let me know what you think  obviously we need to decide quickly.  
4e6bd7523b759607e300251d40578P40578 Bill,  I looked, and youre not a VP of Enron Corp. either.  Maybe you need to give Rick Buy a call so we can straighten this out...  
4e6bd7523b759607e300252640578NP40578 Cindy: Thought I would try e mailing you since using the phone is more of a challenge.  So far so good although I cant say that we are on any type of schedule.  Before I forget, what is the name of the breast pump that you are using  Looks like the one that I have is not that great.  How many ounces should I expect to be able to pump  Im trying to judge whether I should keep this pump.  Anyway, back to Charles Eugene, he is pretty much of a night owl so i try to sleep when he does when I can.  We are ion a feeding frenzy every 21/2 to 3 hours and Im hoping I can extend that at night soon.  Any suggestions  What type of formula do you use  Alos, do you have any secret methods for putting Jillian down to sleep  Do you let her suck on a pacifier  All Charles wants to do is suck on me.  Arthur was better at falling asleep on his own.  Hows Jillian doing   I cant wait to see a picture of her and I will be sending out pictures soon.  Arthur is adjusting well.  He is really into tennis now which I am thrilled about.  We were able to convince Bills mother not to come this weekend because I am not quite up to a visit.  I think she took it well but you never can tell, but at this point I really dont care what she thinks because i am not ready for her to visit until Im more mobile which hopefully I will be in another week or 2.    Sue, How are you and Cate doing  Can you talk to mom about scheduling a  visit so that we can schedule a christening date  Bills older sisters husband Bill is the godfather.  Mom mentioned late August but I would like to pin something down soon so that we can make the necessary arrangements.   Well, Ive got to go as I hear Charles waking up.  Take care both of you and call or write me.  Love, Carol   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713 853 3989 (Phone) 713 646 3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com  
4e6bd7523b759607e30025cb40578P40578 Jeff and Larry:  Last year, Mary Gosnell prepared a one page summary which was used by legal and credit to target the preparation of ISDA Master Agreements.  The summary was divided into two parts:  "Without Master Agreements" and "With ECT Master Agreements" and included the number of trades for the first half of the year.  It is our objective once again to put new agreements into place and upgrade existing ECT Master Agreements to ISDA Master Agreements.  I dont know if EOL trades have impacted the numbers this year and Im not sure whether we need to create a line item for EOL (Ill leave that to your discretion).  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara  P.S.  We were very successful in negotiating masters appearing on Marys list!  
4e6bd7523b759607e30026e440578NP40578 Heres one.  
4e6bd7523b759607e300271040578P40578 This looks fine to me.  The tax section of the draft was a holdover from the initial survey done in Europe last year.  In this case, I assume that Lynn is taking care of the tax issues and may be using different counsel for tax issues.  In Brazil the entire tax section of the memo was deleted before it was sent to counsel.  
4e6bd7523b759607e30027a240578P40578 Im glad to hear from you!  I guess Im a little confused.  I thought you were going to send me your form.  I would be happy to send ours.  I can draft one up in a jiffy.  Just let me know what you prefer.  P.S.  Isnt email wonderful!  
4e6bd7523b759607e30027c640578P40578 Sorry for the delay   our general policy is (and the first response to this type of question should be) that , due to system requirements, it is not possible to provide for different online contracts for different counterparties.  Having said that, in the few cases where a counterparty has raised what we consider to be valid and material concerns, we have agreed to a side letter agreement with that particular counterparty to vary the terms of the ETA.  So if the counterparty resist the first response and threatens to not use the system for legal reasons, you should refer them to the legal department.  They can contact either Carol St. Clair (x33989) or me (x37459).  
4e6bd7523b759607e300284c40578P40578 Thanks for yor message. On another front, I will be in London next week and I would like to meet with the attorneys who will be pursuing the Pacific Valour claim. Did we ever decide on counsel  
4e6bd7523b759607e300288040578NP40578 That will be fine.  Sara  
4e6bd7523b759607e300293e40578P40578 Mark:  I have scheduled a 5 pm flight to NO.  I am attending a wedding Friday night.  I hope this is not a problem, but let me know.  Also, did you receive my voice mail about the Goldman electronic agreement and their denial of my request for injunctive relief upon proof of breach  Id like to finalize this agreement.  Thanks.  Sara  
4e6bd7523b759607e300298340578P40578 I am in London this week and will be meeting with David Best on Thurs to discuss. Thanks for your inquiry. Ill let you know after the meeting.  
4e6bd7523b759607e3002b0440578P40578 Attached are drafts of the Electronic Trading Agreement, Password Application and Privacy Statement for ClickPaper.com.  These are based on the agreements currently in use by EnronOnline.  Greg and John, since they were prepared before our meeting with Mark this afternoon, minimal changes may be necessary, but I thought you might want to start looking at these.  Please call with any comments.    Travis McCullough Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street EB 3817 Houston Texas 77002 Phone:  (713) 853 1575 Fax: (713) 646 3490  
4e6bd7523b759607e3002b1c40578P40578 Joe: Here is the letter agreement that we have agreed to.  Please coordinate with your counterpart at Sempra to have and future ones  executed. Carol  
4e6bd7523b759607e3002cdb40578P40578 FYI   we may need to revise.  Does this ISDA have our new changes  
4e6bd7523b759607e3002ce040578P40578 We need to contact these guys before our legal/credit meeting.  Let me know if you want me to make the contact.  SS  
4e6bd7523b759607e3002e2140578P40578 Mark   thanks for the response. I agree with you that identifying all of the Regulatory Risks associated with either a specific asset (e.g., Sutton Bridge) or a trading book (e.g., UK gas) is impossible.  We could have 50 people spending 100% of their time sitting around dreaming up what ifs and still not see everything.  On the other hand, as your team does now, once we have been able to identify reasonable risks, it is more than appropriate to attempt to impute / calculate the potential loss and assign people to mitigate these risks. On the flip side of the risk coin, the process of identifying Regulatory Risk should also allow Govt Affairs, working with our business colleagues,  to identify rule changes / policy changes that could positively impact our bottom line.  For instance, we could push through regulatory action for a retail rate decrease providing EES with more commodity margin. I dont disagree that these risks which I am trying to track are business risks.  But they are fundamentally the result of changes in regulatory policy (taxes, export/import, rates, etc.).  Because Enron is actively participating in many regulated or semi regulated environments, regulatory risks are business risks. Finally, it is my understanding that Govt Affairs needs to be involved in assisting our business people in managing these risks.  To this end, the Regulatory Risk Working Group has identified the following set of responsibilities for Govt Affairs: _ To identify Regulatory Risks within current assets. _ To analyze pending transactions for Regulatory Risks. _ To recommend alternative commercial arrangements to reduce Regulatory Risk. _ To assess and compute value at risk8 for each Regulatory Risk. _ To develop transfer mechanisms for Regulatory Risk (e.g., insurance). _ To propose and/or plan mitigation devices for Regulatory Risks. _ To assign EGA and/or commercial responsibility and resources for mitigation efforts. _ To review mitigation efforts against existing plans. _ To advocate regulatory frameworks which reduce Regulatory Risk (e.g., BIT). _ To prevent catastrophic Regulatory Risk events ( $25 MM). _ To report to Enron management global Regulatory Risk position. _ To coordinate knowledge with other risk groups within Enron. I look forward to seeing you when you are in Houston and discussing this further.  Like you, I dont want to create some process that provides little to no value. JDS  
4e6bd7593b759607e3002fbb40578NP40578 Pam: We have an opening in our group for a legal assistant position.  Do you know of anyone over there that might be interested  We would prefer someone with transactional experience.  Salary ranges vary depending upon experience, but I think we are pretty competitive.  If you know of anyone please have them call me as we are looking to fill this position ASAP.  Also, would it be possible for you and I to get together 1 more time for lunch before I leave How does the week of July 10th look   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713 853 3989 (Phone) 713 646 3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com  
4e6bd75a3b759607e300305940578NP40578 Bob:  I think we say we want the facility to be revenue enhancing and that we are in favor of joint bids.  Take care.  Mark  
4e6bd75a3b759607e30030d640578P40578 Luanne, I missed a few of Carols changes so she asked me to resend the document. Sorry!  
4e6bd75a3b759607e300314240578P40578 Robert: I am still waiting to hear back from our credit person on some of the credit comments that you made, but here is my response to the legal and certain of the credit comments:  1. I am okay with the first paragraph of Insert 1.  I would like to talk to you about the second paragraph.  2. We have a strong preference and policy towards using Loss rather than Market Quotation.  3. Inserts 2, 3, 4 and 5 are okay.  In addition. our tax people are now advising us to require the delivery of W 9s to part 3.  4. NY is okay with governing law.  5. On arbitration, other than changing the location, I would prefer to go with our language and really didnt see much difference in what you sent other than the fact that it was more abbreviated. Did I miss something  6. In Part 5, Section (e), 10 Business Days is too long.  How about 5  7. In Part 5, Section (f), your requested change is too narrow for us.  We can agree that any calls coming in to or going out from trading, marketing and financial/credit personnel will be recorded.  Does that work for you  8. Insert 7 is okay.   9. Your reduction of the rounding amount is okay.,  10. Your comments on page 4 of Annex A are okay.  11. Your comment on Annex A, page 5 is problematic for us unless we limit posted collateral to LCs only.  12. On page 6 of Annex A, can we include both the Issuer and the pledgor  13. Insert 8 is okay, as are the remaining comments on page 7 of Annex A except that we need Moodys because it is used in the LC language.  14. On the LC provisions, in 1(a) can we put "either the Issuer or X" and in 1(b) include your language as an alternative  15. I need to discuss with you your deletion of clause (ii) of 1(d).  We would like the right to draw if an Event of Default has occurred and if no payment is owed at such time, to hold it as cash collateral.  16. Raising the guaranty cap is okay as are the chnages that you made in Section 2 of the Guaranty.  17. Inserts 10, 11 and 12 are okay.  18. In Section 6(c), I would like to keep that phrase as it refers to the Payment Demand procedure.  19. Your chnages to Section 7 of the Guaranty are okay.  20. We can change governing law to NY but as a matter of enron policy, cannot agree to Insert 13.  21. Insert 14 is okay although I may reword it slightly to make it clearer that this applies in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding.  I am waiting to hear back from my credit person with respect to the Minimum Transfer Amount comment, the LC transfer language comment and the language of Insert 9.  I look forward to hearing from you.  I will not be in the office monday or tuesday.  Alos, we have recently revised our ISDA Schedule to include the following language at the end of Part 6.  Sorry for the late notice.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713 853 3989 (Phone) 713 646 3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

As you may or may not be aware, the products the company trades has expanded beyond energy commodities, we trade interest rates  currencies, pulp  paper, weather, and metals.  I am sure this product base will continue to expand.

4e6bd75b3b759607e300352040578P40578 Dear Jessica,  As you requested, this afternoon I faxed to you a certificate signed by the Assistant Secretary of Enron North America Corp. indicating that ENA was the sole member of Enron Midstream Services, L.L.C.  I hope this document satisfied your request.  Please advise if youd like the original sent to you via intra company mail, or if you need additional information or documentation.  Best wishes, Mary 713 853 7796  
4e6bd75b3b759607e300354140578P40578 Gene, As you my recall, you returned the original subcontractor letter with respect to the referenced agreement as you were unable to locate the original Project Services Agreement in Enrons files.  I was just talking to Carol St. Clair, one of the attorneys I work for, and we are of the agreement that we cannot sign this side subcontractor letter until we track down where the original agreement is.  How can we locate the orignal agreement within Enron Corp.

4e6bd75c3b759607e300373c40578P40578 David and Louise: One of the things that Organic has asked us to keep confidential is "the existence of any business discussions, negotiations or agreements between the parties as well as any information regarding the skills and compensation of employees, contractors or other agents of the disclosing party."  This is a departure from our form.  Are we prepared to agree to this  Also, to the extent that parties are insisting on using their form of CA, what do you want the approval process to be Carol

4e6bd75c3b759607e30037fc40578P40578 Sara:  When you have a chance, would you forward me a sample confirmation for one of the above referenced trades   I want to have a sense of the terms of the GTCs attached to such confirmations when an ISDA master is not in place with a counterparty.  Thanks.    David  
4e6bd75c3b759607e300382b40578P40578 Kristina:  As you may have heard, some Raptor issues have been raised to a new level.  I have waited to further revise the confirm pending the VE response; Also VE suggested edits on the confirm format for all Raptor deals.  As you will see from Scotts memo, the unilateral right of termination is a potential issue.  Sara

4e6bd75c3b759607e3003a2840578P40578 Elizabeth: We are in the process of negotiating 2 ISDA masters with a counterparty, 1 with ENA and 1 with PGE.  In looking at our setoff language, it would appear as if under certain circumstances the application of such language would result in PGE subsidizing ENAs payment obligations.  How would you suggest we handle this  If we do nothing and such provision is unenforceable and we rely on our severability language, are we okay Carol  
4e6bd75c3b759607e3003a4c40578P40578 We may have some problems with derivatives trading in Mexico   see Tanas note from earlier today.  Ill start the process for the ETA  PA.

4e6bd75d3b759607e3003d3b40578NP40578 Sorry I cant wish you well in person but I have a severe case of laryngitis!. Fortunately, Im on antibiotics but the doctor said "Dont speak for 3 days.  I wish my wife would get laryngitis."  Maybe the desert air in Arizona would bring relief.  I love saguros (is that right)  Daddy thought planning for Chanukah was a great idea.  Also, tell Daddy that if he used e mail I could talk to him even when I have laryngitis.  Love, Sas  
4e6bd75d3b759607e3003d3e40578P40578 Kaye:  I e mailed David Portz this morning and he hasnt opened the message. Can you please (1) find out if hes even in the office today AND (2) just get a copy of the agreement which Dale is referencing below.  Thanks.  SS

4e6bd75d3b759607e3003d7240578P40578 I still cant talk.  I think that our response should be final except that there may be some agreed to changes on the L/C side.  Carol St. Clair is addressing that with Jennifer and Miriam.  In any event, I believe that Tiger needs to "OK" our response of yesterday since there were some errors on their redraft.  Marie is not in the office today.  If you want to speak to a person, call Susan Bailey and she can come into my office and we can manage. Have a good weekend.  Sara

4e6bd75d3b759607e3003fce40578P40578 We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of March 31, 2000 assigning two physical Canadian gas trades (EOL Deal Nos 137945 and 149472) from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce to CIBC World Markets plc.  Such trades will be governed by the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement dated November 16, 1999 between CIBC World Markets plc and Enron Canada Corp.  Copies will be distributed  
4e6bd75d3b759607e3003fe740578P40578 Rod: The following are the credit issues that they raised in their comments: 1. Cross default threshold   instead of $100,000,000 they want a 3% of equity test. 2. Credit Event Upon Merger   they want to delete the amendment language in our Schedule 3. MAC Trigger   this currently is an Event of Default.  They want to make it a Termination Event.  Also, they want to add to the trigger going below a Baa3 rating by Moodys. 4.  In the financial reporting section, they want to add on our side a requirement that we deliver to them any financial or business report that we make available to our shareholders or that we file with the SEC or bank regulatory authorities 5. In the Netting language, they have excluded FX and Currency Option transactions. 6. In the setoff language, they have limited the trigger to the designation of an Early Termination date because of the Termination Event Credit Event Upon Merger.  Alos, they want setoff to apply to "matured and unmatured" obligations. 7. They dont want a cap on the Enron Guaranty 8. In the Termination section where we specify Loss and Second method that have an interesting rider (insert 2) that modifies how the Second Method works.  Im still trying to understand what this language does but it appears to qualify any payments on termination that the Non Defaulting Party would have to make to the Defaulting Party. I will send you a copy of their comments and hopefully we will talk to them about this next week.  
4e6bd75d3b759607e300400240578P40578 Jay:  I am a lawyer with Enron.  I called for you on Friday, youre out, and no one else could help.  I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1) replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a broader range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant ISDA definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even though the master is an early master energy price swap agreement.

4e6bd75e3b759607e30040ff40578P40578 Jeff: Alicia and I will get back to you with a mark up with our thoughts on this since some of the langugae appears to be different from what is in the Revolver.  Alicia thought that maybe this langugae came from Condor.  My objective here is to make sure that there is some good precedent for this language and that this deal does not create a new standard.

4e6bd75e3b759607e300411e40578NP40578 Sara: I spoke with Mark about this and he was all in favor of having a party for Marie although I got the feeling that if we wait on him to organize it it wont happen.  Anyway, would you consider having a get together at your house  We were just going to limit it to the swap group.  Let me know what you think.  Carol  
4e6bd75e3b759607e300419440578P40578 Jon, it was attached to the bottom of his prior email, which I will resend to you right now.  MHC  
4e6bd75e3b759607e30041b140578P40578 Rob: I am faxing to you our comments to the latest drafts of Schedules.  Our credit person has agreed to make the MAC trigger as an additional Termination Event so long as (1) we limit the trigger to the SP rating; (2) we provide a cure concept that the non Affected Party controls subject to a cap; and (3) we remove the MAC trigger from the collateral threshold definition.  I have included some proposed language.  Also, with respect to the partnership agreement, I seem to recall that you were reluctant to send us a copy as we traditionally review LP agreements as a part of our due diligence.  Is that still the case  I like what you did on the Termination Event but we need some comfort that you cannot alter or narrow the GPs liability that is provided by statute.  Could you please give that some thought and we can talk further about it  Tomorrow is bad for me to talk but the rest of the week after tomorrow looks good if you have some time. Carol  
4e6bd75e3b759607e30041d340578P40578 Russell: Just wanted to confirm that what you said in your e mail overrides what is in the credit worksheet as some of the numbers were different.  Please advise. Carol  
4e6bd75e3b759607e300421140578P40578 Attached is a revised LOI and Term Sheet.  A redlined version of the LOI is attached, but the redlining function does not work on the term sheet (which was constructed with the "Tables" function).  The sections of the term sheet that changed are those entitled "Posting Agreement", "Transfer Rights", and "Registration Rights."  Please call me at X31575 with any comments or questions.  
4e6bd75e3b759607e300421340578P40578 Russell: Here is what their letter should say to us: Reference is made to the Guaranty Agreement dated as of September 1, 1998 from American Central Gas Companies, Inc. ("Guarantor") for the benefit of Enron North America Corp. ("Enron").  By letter addressed to you dated April 6, 2000 (the "Termination Letter"), Guarantor terminated its obligations under the Guaranty.  The purpose of this letter is to notify Enron that such Termination Letter is null and void such that no termination of the Guaranty by Guarantor has occurred.  In addition, Guarantor hereby agrees to amend the Guaranty by (1) changing the amount set forth in Section 1(b) from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 and (2) by changing the text of the fourth paragraph in Section 6 to read as follows:  "This Guaranty shall terminate on the date (such date being the "Termination Date") that is the earlier of (a) July __, 2000 or (b) the effective date of any written notice of termination sent by Guarantor as set forth below.   Guarantor may terminate this Guaranty by providing written notice of such termination to ECT and upon the effectiveness of such termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.  No such termination by Guarantor shall be effective until five (5) days after receipt by ECT of such termination notice.  No termination of this Guaranty pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall affect Guarantors liability with respect to any Transaction (as defined in the Contracts) entered into prior to the Termination Date, which Transaction shall remain guaranteed pursuant to the terms of this Guaranty." Please acknowledge your acceptance of the terms of this letter, by signing in the space provided below.
